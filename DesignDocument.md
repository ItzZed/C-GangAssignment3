Anticipated Issues:

Possible merge conflicts on github
Handling possible inconsistencies in the CSV file (e.g. if two values are encased in quotation marks)
Sorting tables by integers and strings efficiently
Ensuring exportDB outputs an identical CSV file
Ensuring consistent coding style and comments throughout all files
